# Hi, I'm Ken 👋

### Biomedical Informatics Student & Robotics Enthusiast
I am currently a 2nd-year student at the University of Thessaly, Department of Computer Science and Biomedical Informatics. My interest lies at the intersection of **Software Engineering**, **Robotics**, and **Artificial Intelligence** applied to healthcare.

### Tech Stack & Tools
* **Languages:** C (Low-level systems), C++ (OOP & Data Structures), Java (Android Basics)
* **Fields of Interest:** Robotics (ROS), Medical Signal Processing, Embedded Systems
* **Currently Learning:** Modern C++, Android Development, and Signal Processing

### Featured Projects
* **[Generic Data Structures in C](https://github.com/UTHorSmthingIDK/Generic-Data-Structures-in-C):** High-performance implementation of Stacks, Queues, and Lists using `void*` for generic use. Focused on manual memory management and pointers.
* **[Cryptography in C](https://github.com/UTHorSmthingIDK/Cryptography-in-C):** I found cryptography interesting and decided to give it a try.
* **[Library Management System](https://github.com/UTHorSmthingIDK/Library-Management-System):** Exploring OOP principles in C++, focusing on classes, inheritance, and (currently refactoring) smart memory management.

### What I'm working on
-  Improving my **C** knowledge by implementing data structures
-  refreshing my **Java** knowledge by trying out Android studio
-  Improving my **C++** skills to "Modern C++" standards (C++17/20).
